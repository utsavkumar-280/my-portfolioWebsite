    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE</strong> </h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Aperture---Shutter speed---ISO</h2>


    <div class="container container-center">
        <h2>Aperture</h2>
        <p>The aperture is a small set of blades in the lens that controls how much light will enter the camera. The
            bladeS create a octagonal shape that can be widened (we photogs call it shooting “wide open”), or closed
            down to a
            small hole.&nbsp; Obviously, if you shoot with the aperture wide open, then more light is allowed into the
            camera than if the aperture is closed down to only allow a tiny hole of light to enter the camera.</p>


        <p>So suppose you take a picture that is too bright.&nbsp;Simply choose a smaller aperture. &nbsp;Simple!
            Aperture
            sizes are measured by f-stops. &nbsp;A high f-stop like f-22 means that the aperture hole is quite small,
            and a
            low f-stop like f/3.5 means that the aperture is wide open.</p>

        <img class="pics" src="/assets/aperture.png" alt="aperture-img" width="650px">
        <p>The aperture also controls the depth-of-field. Depth-of-field is how much of the picture is sharp, and how
            much
            is blurry. If you want to take a picture of a person with a blurry background, you'd use shallow depth of
            field.&nbsp; If you want to take a picture of a sweeping mountain vista, you'd want to use a small aperture
            size
            (high f-stop number) so that the entire scene is in sharp focus. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="container container-center">
        <h2>Shutter Speed</h2>

        <p>The shutter is a small “curtain” in the camera that quickly rolls over the image sensor (the digital version
            of film) and allows light to shine onto the imaging sensor for a fraction of a second. The longer the
            shutter
            allows light to shine onto the image sensor, the brighter the picture since more light is gathered. &nbsp;A
            darker picture is produced when the shutter moves very quickly and only allows light to touch the imaging
            sensor
            for a tiny fraction of a second. The duration that the shutter allows light onto the image sensor is called
            the
            shutter speed, and is measured in fractions of a second. &nbsp;So a shutter speed of 1/2 of a second will
            allow
            more light to touch the image sensor and will produce a brighter picture than a shutter speed of 1/200 of a
            second. So if you're taking a picture and it is too dark, you could use a slower shutter speed to allow the
            camera to gather more light.</p>

        <img class="pics" src="/assets/shutter-speed.jpg" alt="shutter-speed-img" width="650px">
        <p>Just as the aperture affects the exposure as well as the depth-of field, the shutter affects more than just
            the
            exposure. &nbsp;The shutter speed is also principally responsible for controlling the amount of blur in a
            picture. If you think about it, it makes sense that the shutter speed controls how much blur is in the
            picture.
        </p>

        <p>Imagine me sitting here at my computer desk waving to you (you don't have to imagine very hard if you just
            look
            at the picture on the right). If you take a picture of me with a shutter speed of 1/30th of a second, then
            my
            hand will have moved in the time that the camera is recording the picture. &nbsp;To get rid of the blur, you
            need to increase the shutter speed to around 1/320th of a second. &nbsp;At this speed, my hand is still
            moving,
            but the camera takes the picture so fast that my hand travels only such a small distance that it is not
            noticeable in the picture.</p>

    <div class="container container-center">
        <h2>ISO</h2>

        <p>The funny thing about ISO is that it is an acronym, but nobody really knows what it stands for. &nbsp;It is
            always just called ISO even though it really stands for International Organization for Standardization.
            &nbsp;Every once in a while, you'll hear an older photographer pronounce it “I-so”, but almost everyone
            pronounces it “I.S.O.” The ISO controls the exposure by using software in the camera to make it extra
            sensitive to light.</p>
        <img class="pics" src="/assets/iso.jpg" alt="iso-img" width="650px">
        <p>A high ISO such as ISO 25000 will produce a brighter picture than a lower ISO such as ISO 100. The drawback
            to increasing the ISO is that it makes the picture noisier. &nbsp;Digital noise is apparent when a photo
            looks grainy. Have you ever taken a picture at night with your cell phone or your pocket camera, and noticed
            that it looks really grainy? &nbsp;That is because the camera tried to compensate for the dark scene by
            choosing a high ISO, which causes more grain.</p>
